ADM,Archer Daniels Midland ,Agribusiness,Consumer,Feedstock supplier to renewable diesel productions. Corn ethanol and biodiesel production,Positive,Biofuels & Renewable Diesel,"Renewable diesel is a biofuel (fuel that is made from biomass materials) that is chemically the same as petroleum diesel fuel. It can be produced from cellulosic biomass materials such as crop residues, wood and sawdust, and switchgrass, and it qualifies as an advanced biofuel under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program. Conventional diesel is one of most efficient and energy dense fuels available today, which is why it is widely used in passenger vehicles, commercial trucks, home and industrial generators, and heating oil. As the fuel most consumed globally and given the broad focus on decarbonization, renewable diesel has a key role to play as a potential, clean substitute for conventional diesel.   The actual conversion process for renewable diesel relies on the transformation of various oils (e.g., soybean oil, animal fats) into fuel.

BE,Bloom Energy ,Clean Tech.,Energy,Bloom has formed partnerships with the California dairy industry to use RNG as feedstock for Bloom's fuel cells,Positive,Renewable Natural Gas,"Renewable Natural Gas is a substitute for conventional methane and natural gas that is made from renewable, organic, feedstocks like landfill gas, animal manure, and municipal solid waste. There are three ways RNG can be created: anaerobic digestion, thermal gasification, and power-to-gas systems. Anaerobic digestion is a process where microorganisms break down feedstocks (landfill gas, animal manure, water resource recovery facilities, and food waste) over time and the gaseous end-products of methane and carbon dioxide can be used. Thermal gasification subjects feedstocks (agricultural residue, forestry products and residues, energy crops, and municipal solid waste) to intense heat and pressure that will result in a number of ending gases like hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. RNG can also be produced with renewable energy powering electrolysis to generate hydrogen, which is added to CO2 to result in methane.  RNG's climate impact is significant because of its ability to prevent methane (CH4), a gas that causes 25x more damage than CO2 over a 100-year period.
